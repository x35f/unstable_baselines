    0 - No guess yet submitted (only after reset)
    1 - Guess is lower than the target
    2 - Guess is equal to the target
    3 - Guess is higher than the target

    The rewards are:
    0 if the agent's guess is outside of 1% of the target
    1 if the agent's guess is inside 1% of the target

    The episode terminates after the agent guesses within 1% of
    the target or 200 steps have been taken

    The agent will need to use a memory of previously submitted
    actions and observations in order to efficiently explore
    the available actions.

    The purpose is to have agents able to optimise their exploration
    parameters based on histories. Since the observation only provides
    at most the direction of the next step agents will need to alter
    they way they explore the environment (e.g. binary tree style search)
    in order to achieve a good score

    The goal of the game is to effective use the reward provided
    in order to understand the best action to take.

    After each step the agent receives an observation of:
    0 - No guess yet submitted (only after reset)
    1 - Guess is lower than the target
    2 - Guess is equal to the target
    3 - Guess is higher than the target

    The rewards is calculated as:
    ((min(action, self.number) + self.bounds) / (max(action, self.number) + self.bounds)) ** 2
    This is essentially the squared percentage of the way the
    agent has guessed toward the target.

    Ideally an agent will be able to recognise the 'scent' of a
    higher reward and increase the rate in which is guesses in that
    direction until the reward reaches its maximum.
    ''',

    It is possible to reach the maximum reward within 2 steps if
    an agent is capable of learning the reward dynamics (one to
    determine the direction of the target, the second to jump
    directly to the target based on the reward).
